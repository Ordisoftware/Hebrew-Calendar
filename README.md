## Frequently asked questions

#### What to do if the check update tells that the SSL certificate is wrong or expired?

The software verifies the validity of the certificate of the update server in addition to the SHA-512 checksum of the installation file before downloading and running it. This certificate is normally updated within the two months of its annual expiration and a new version is released. You can manually check the latest version available online in case of problem.

#### What to do if the monthly view is ugly?

Reset the preferences to default: it will restore the corrupted values in case of a problem after install or upgrade.

#### What to do if the application does not work normally despite restoring settings?

Use the Start Menu link:

&emsp;`Ordisoftware\Hebrew Calendar\Reset Hebrew Calendar settings`

This will erase all settings as well as those of old versions, which should resolve issues if there is a conflict, otherwise please contact support.

#### What is the Windows double-buffering?

When enabled, this will speed up rendering of the main form when it is displayed, but it may cause a slight black flicker.

When disabled, top menu painting may cause latency.

#### What are known problems?

Data generated for cities near the poles can be inconsistent the closer we get, especially with the moon omer, due to some weird ephemeris.

Thus celebration dates may be wrong.

#### What are command-line options?

- Change interface language (does not change the text report unless using --generate):

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --lang [en|fr]`

- Show the main window:

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --show`

- Hide the main window:

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --hide`

- Generate the calendar:
 
  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --generate`

- Reset the reminder:
 
  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --resetreminder`

- Show the navigation window:
 
  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --navigate`

- Show the dates difference calculator:
 
  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --diffdates`

- Show the celebration verses board:

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --celebrationverses`

- Show the celebrations board:

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --celebrations`

- Show the new moons board:
 
  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --newmoons`

- Show the lunar months board:

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --lunarmonths`

- Show the parashot board:

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --parashot`

- Show the weekly parashah description box:

  `Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe --parashah`

These options are cumulative and can be used to control the software when it is already running.

It is therefore possible to use [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com) to define for example this Shift + Ctrl + Alt + P command:

```
!^+P:: 
  appPath := "C:\Program Files\Ordisoftware\Hebrew Calendar\Bin\"
  appExe := "Ordisoftware.Hebrew.Calendar.exe"
  sleep 500
  Run %appPath%%appExe% --parashot
  return
```

#### What are the times of celebration?

The times of the Torah's celebrations are Pesach or Easter which is the liberation of illusions, Shavu'ot or Weeks which is the gift of knowledge, Teru'ah or Ringtone which is the joy of being freedom, Kipurim or Atonement which is the sorrows of losses, and Sukot or Tabernacles which is the construction of the future.

These are important moments of the lunar year in the solar cycle whose purpose is to provide a benevolent evolution of consciousness by the knowledge of the laws of the universe and of life. The Torah says to count these days according to the moon, as opposed to Shabat which is counted according to the sun.

The application uses by default moon omer for celebrations.

If you use moon omer then celebrations dates will be calculated according to seasons and there will be an inversion between north and south hemispheres. In this case, a day is from one moon set to the next set.

You can use traditional sun days by modifying the option in the reminder, hence celebrations will be same in north and south. In this case, a day is from one sun set to the next set.

#### What is Shabat?

The Shabat is the "day of rest" where one do not work for a livelihood. Unless there is a vital emergency, the body, the emotions and the spirit are resting there. The study of the Torah is a privileged activity.

The tradition attributes this day to Saturday. We can however think according to Bereshit 1.1 that in the case where the first day is the day of birth as a corollary to the fusion of the gametes then it takes place the day before: thus a person coming to the world on a Sunday will have his Shabat the Saturday. From Bereshit 1.5 and 1.16 as well as from Shemot 20.8 it can be deduced that it lasts from sunset on the eve of the calendar day to sunset on the same day. For example, for a person born in Paris, the Shabat of February 19, 2019 takes place from Friday 18 at 17:25 to Saturday at 17:25 approximately.

The personal Shabat of a married or concubin or divorced man is the previous day of the birth. A son follows his father's Shabat. The Shabat of a woman is the Shabat of her father or her husband or her concubin.

So the man and the woman respect their mutual cycles. Indeed, during the period when the married or concubine or divorced woman is Nidah from the beginning to the end of the blood flow, her vital field is dissonant and the couple avoid touching each other (the virgin girl is not concerned as long as she had no relations through the openings of the begetting) to avoid to increase as well as to transmit this state to things and people (otherwise we follow the rules of the Torah about that).

If the man were born between midnight and the sunset, the Shabat is the day before. Between sunset and midnight, the Shabat is that day. This day is from previous day (or previous previous day) at sunset to this day (or previous day) at sunset.

The day of the Shabat goes from sunset on the previous calendar day to sunset of that day, with 3% of natural margin that to say about one hour.

The day before, either the man keeps without going out and strengthens the couple during the Shabat, or he goes out and lights up the couple for Shabat, but on Shabat he does not go out of his temple, and except in case of emergency we do not produce, transform and destroys nothing, we don't plan anything, we don't work, we don't cook, we don't shave, we don't cut, we don't make fire, we don't care about information, etc. But we can for example take part in sports, study science and play with children.

If you prefer to use the traditional group Shabat, select for example Saturday for Judaism, Sunday for Christianity or Friday for Islam.

#### What are parashot?

The study of the Weekly Torah portion begins at Sim'hat Torah with the Bereshit section on 22 Tishri in the Land of Israel, or on 23 in Mitsraïm and in the desert, that is on the last day of Sukot, or the next day.

It ends with full reading on Shabat, or the next Shabat if Sim'hat Torah occurs on Shabat. The day after Shabat we move on to the next parashah that we study during the week by reading comments, listening to conferences, learning about science, and examining letters, words and verses, to read it in full on Shabat. And so on from week to week to go through the Torah in a year to build a better future world for oneself, for one's family, for one's community, for one's country, for the Nations, and for the species, thanks to Pesach, Shavu'ot, Teru'ah, Kipurim, and Sukot.

Israël is the conceptual worldwide land of the righteous benevolent whose body+spirit, and therefore DNA, is to some notable extent free from ignorance and evil. Sim'hat Torah means 'Joy [bestowed by the] Torah' and a Lettriq of Sim'hat is 'Sharing of the Service which Sustains the Matter': it is therefore the joy resulting from the beneficial help of the Torah and those which follow the laws of the country where one lives and the Doctrine of YHVH which have for one and only fundamental purpose to protect the life and the goods of the people without harming even the wicked and the criminals.

The number of Parashot is 54 that is to say נד which is the Power of the Student and that root means To pass from the malevolent world to that of the good.

The generation of parashot relating to Shabatot is not guaranteed to be traditional especially as the application generates dates, although based on the lunar cycle, which can sometimes vary a little from official calendars, especially if the moon omer is used and even more with the personal Shabat.
