    <h3>Frequently asked questions</h3>
    <h4>How to install SQlite ODBC Driver?</h4>
    <p>The setup installs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/sqliteodbc.exe" rel="nofollow">sqliteodbc.exe</a> on Windows 32-bit.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.ch-werner.de/sqliteodbc/sqliteodbc_w64.exe" rel="nofollow">sqliteodbc_w64.exe</a> on Windows 64-bit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span class="tlid-translation translation" lang="en"><span title="" class="">In the event that an error message indicates that a DLL file could not be copied, it is usually due to the fact that an application using this driver already installed is running and is blocking the file.</span> <span title="" class="">You can ignore this error or close the application in question and restart the installation to obtain a driver update.</span></span></p>
    <h4>What to do in case of ODBC datasource connection error?</h4>
    <p>The software tries to register an ODBC DSN to the registry but in case 
of problem run &quot;C:\Program Files\Ordisoftware\Hebrew Calendar\Register 
ODBC.reg&quot; or open the ODBC datasource manager (Admin tools in Windows' 
Control panel) and create a user datasource named &quot;Hebrew-Calendar&quot; for 
&quot;SQLite 3 ODBC Driver&quot; with &quot;Database Name&quot; sets to:</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 8pt;">&quot;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Ordisoftware\Hebrew Calendar\Hebrew-Calendar.sqlite&quot;</span></p>
    <p>Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPVF8pj9I3E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video</a>.</p>
    <h4>What to do if the check update tells that the SSL certificate is wrong or expired?</h4>
    <p>The software verifies the validity of the certificate of the update server in addition to the SHA-512 checksum of the installation file before downloading and running it. This certificate is normally updated within the two months of its annual expiration and a new version is released. If the application has not been updated within this period, you can manually check the latest version available online.</p>
    <h4>What to do if the calendar month view is ugly?</h4>
    <p>Reset the preferences to default: it will restore the corrupted values in case of a problem after install or upgrade.</p>
    <h4>What are the times of celebration?</h4>
    <p>The times of the Torah's celebrations are Pesa'h or Easter which is the liberation of illusions, Shavuot or Weeks which is the gift of knowledge, Teru'ah or Ringtone which is the joy of being freedom,&nbsp;Kipurim or Atonement&nbsp;which is the sorrows of losses, and Sukot or Tabernacles&nbsp;which is the construction of the future.</p>
    <p>These are important moments of the lunar year in the solar cycle whose purpose
is to provide a benevolent evolution of consciousness by the knowledge of the laws of the universe and of life. The Torah says to count these days according to the moon, as opposed to Shabat which is counted according to the sun.</p>
    <p>The application uses by default moon omer for celebrations.</p>
    <p>If you use moon omer then celebrations dates will be calculated according to seasons and there will be an inversion between north and south hemispheres. In this case, a day is from one moon set to the next set.</p>
    <p>You can use traditionnals sun days by modifying the option in the reminder, hence celebrations will be same in north and south. In this case, a day is from one sun set to the next set.</p>
    <h4>What is Shabat?</h4>
    <p>The shabat is &nbsp;the &quot;day of rest&quot; where one do not work for a livelihood. Unless
 there is a vital emergency, the body, the emotions and the spirit are resting 
there. The study of the Torah is a privileged activity.</p>
    <p>The tradition 
attributes this day to Saturday. We can however think according to 
Béréshit 1.1 that in the case where the first day is the day of birth 
as a corollary to the fusion of the gametes then it takes place the day 
before: thus a person coming to the world on a Sunday will have his 
Shabat the Saturday. From Béréshit 1.5 and 1.16 as well as from Shémot 
20.8 it can be deduced that it lasts from sunset on the eve of the 
calendar day to sunset on the same day. For example, for a person born 
in Paris, the Shabat of February 19, 2019 takes place from Friday 18 at 
17:25 to Saturday at 17:25 approximately.</p>
    <p>The personal shabat of a maried or concubin or divorced man is the previous day of the birth. A son follows his father's shabat. The shabat of a woman is the shabat of her father or her husband or her concubin. So the man and the woman respect their mutual cycles. Indeed, during the period when the married or concubine or divorced woman is Nidah from the beginning to the end of the blood flow, her vital field is dissonant and the couple avoid touching each other (the virgin girl is not concerned as long
as she had no relations through the openings of the begetting) to avoid to increase as well as to transmit this state to things and people (otherwise we follow the rules of the Torah about that).</p>
    <p>If the man were born between midnight and the sunset, the shabat is the day before. Between sunset and midnight, the shabat is that day. This day is from previous day (or previous previous day) at sunset to this day (or previous day) at sunset. The day of the shabat goes from sunset on the previous calendar day to sunset of that day, with 3% of natural margin that to say about one hour. The day before, either the man keeps without going out and strengthens the couple during the shabat, or he goes out and
lights up the couple for shabat, but on shabat he does not go out of his temple, and except in case of emergency we do not produce, transform and destroys nothing, we don't plan anything, we don't work, we don't cook, we don't shave, we don't cut, we don't make fire, we don't care about information, etc. But we can for example take part in sports, study science and play with children.</p>
    <p>If you prefer to use the traditional group shabat, select for example Saturday for Judaism, Sunday for Christianity or Friday for Islam.</p>
